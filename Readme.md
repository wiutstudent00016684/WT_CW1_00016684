I have created the copy of mohirdev using the programming skills we have covered during seminars. My website is consisted of 6 pages such as home, about us, courses, sign up ,teachers and contacts. In my homepage you can see brief information about Mohirdev and its available courses. I added preloader to make my home page more interactive and user friendly. I added form validations for my contacts and sign up page using JavaScript.Moreover, I added all the necessary styles using css and made it responsive. Now this website can be interactively used by mobile phones, tablets, laptops and so on. I also posted my website to a hosting service called netflify.
